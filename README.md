# Outreach Schedules

Small Clojure library (script, rather) for auto-generating a SQL printout for all sponsor schedules.

## Usage

1. Open `./src/core.clj`
2. Update sponsor ids. Sponsor ids are a list of exclusive sponsors (and perhaps other criteria):

Dataclip for sponsor ids: "Exclusive Sponsors"

3. Update p-value.
4. Update holiday list.
5. Evaluate the file in the REPL.
5. Run the `write-sql` command shown in the comments.
